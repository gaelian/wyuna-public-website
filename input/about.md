SubTitle: What's all this then?
---
Established in 1985, the Wyuna Community is a group of people who feel that the quality of life in our society is far
from what it should be at presesnt and in fact, our very survival is being threatened by the rampant lack of ecological
responsibility on the planet. In seeking solutions to the ecological imbalances of the past, we place humans in the
center stage and accept responsbility for our own evolution. We aim to research and assess small and more appropriate
farming and building techniques, focussing on appropriate technology and alternative energy sources, simultaneously
addressing perhaps the most basic area of all - living alternatives to wage/income dependance and the development of
creative leisure in a society where jobs are rapidly disappearing.

We aim to live together as an intentional family, to follow lifestyles chosen by ourselves (rather than by circumstance)
which provide maximum opportunities for human and spiritual growth. We aim to build a body of information and experience
which will be of value to others concerned with self-empowerment, human relationships and communal living.

We choose Australia (Canberra, ACT) as our home and accept as our starting point the theoretical work of Dr Jim Cairns,
whose energy was the catalyst for this project.
